# Blockchain

Built my own simple general use blockchain.

You can add onto the block dictionary all of the data you would like.

You can also test this out yourself by changing the IP & Port address to the one of your choice.

Finally, make a GET request on Postman as the format:

         
          To view the whole chain
          http://ip:port/get_chain
          
              AND
              
          To mine the blocks    
          http://ip:port/mine_block
